# Text Encryption App
This project is a simple web application that encrypts and decrypts texts using a custom encryption scheme. The application allows users to exchange secret messages with others who know the encryption key.

## Encryption Keys
- The letter "e" is replaced with "enter"
- The letter "i" is replaced with "imes"
- The letter "a" is replaced with "ai"
- The letter "o" is replaced with "ober"
- The letter "u" is replaced with "ufat"

## Requirements
- The app should only work with lowercase letters.
- No accented letters or special characters should be used.
- It should be possible to convert a word to its encrypted version and vice versa.

## Features
- Input fields for entering text to be encrypted or decrypted.
- Options to choose between encryption and decryption.
- Display the result on the screen.
- A button to copy the encrypted/decrypted text to the clipboard, similar to the ctrl+C command.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS (Tailwind)
- JavaScript

## How to Use
